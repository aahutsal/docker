# Docker Image for Squirrel SQL

Image based on Ubuntu Trusty (LTS), configured with JRE 7, with Squirrel SQL.

There's a [script](squirrel) to start a container, making the host's X display available to the container. It runs with the same user and also makes the home available, making a seamless development experience.
